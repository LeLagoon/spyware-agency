![38](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/76ca1ade-12fb-4435-a459-8067d1f0fabb)

3 Spy Gadgets -

1. THE INTERVAL - The Interval may seem like an ordinary smartwatch, but it has distinct features that prioritize the agent's safety.
2. THE COMPENDIUM - This state of the art mobile phone which has two OS - the normal OS and DADA OS. The agent will have to verify his data to access the main OS.
3. THE CANISTER - Cigarette box: It would contain an acid which can only be opened in a specific way. If opened by anyone who is not aware of the mechanism the acid would leak killing the person.

The site is at first a cover site which looks normal but after entereing a specific code it leads to the real spy dashboard. The site is thus called THE BLINDFOLD.
